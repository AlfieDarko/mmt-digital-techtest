# The Challenge:

Produce a HTML snippet for the Hero banner of the website design provided, treating it as a standalone component (don't worry about the HTML or styles for any other elements of the design.)  
Full PSD designs including versions for tablet and mobile devices are provided as a guideline, and as a source for extracting imagery and style information.

Develop the HTML and CSS for this element using the techniques and patterns as you would normally.
