  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <!--
  		This is a blank slate project for you to show us what you can do.
  		
  		The PSD / JPG file in the root of this project demonstrates a simple static
  		landing page for a client.  Approach the task in any way you see fit, and as 
  		much as possible work as you would normally.  
  		
  		We don't expect you to be able to complete the entire page in the time available,
  		but be prepared to talk about what you've done and how you'd take your work
  		further afterwards.
