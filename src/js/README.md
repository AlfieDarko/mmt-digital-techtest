# The Challenge:

Your task is to populate the pre-defined table with the data from the `JSON` file provided. Basic HTML and CSS styles are included in this template, this is simply exploring the techniques you would use to load external data and append it to the DOM. You are free to use any frameworks or libraries you want.

You are required to add functionality to **sort**, **filter**, **paginate** and **search** this data using JavaScript.
