# MMT Digital Front-end Test

Welcome to the MMT Digital Front-end test. This test will hopefully give you a chance to showcase your skills as a developer. You get **1.5 hours** to complete the test. After the test, we will ask you to talk through your code and decisions. Alright, let's do this!

## The challenge

We would like you to re-create the following basket:

![The basket](https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.dribbble.com%2Fusers%2F42384%2Fscreenshots%2F668649%2Fattachments%2F59014%2Fcart_update_large.png)

## Things we love

* Non-jquery implementations
* Tip-top styling, using mixins and modern techniques
* Well linted, consistent code
* A fully working non-perfect solution, over a beautiful broken one
* Frequent Git use with clear commit messages

## Bonus points

* Accessibility considerations
* Unit testing
* Progressive enhancement considerations
* Next gen JavaScript, ES6+

## Getting started

*You will need node on your machine (https://nodejs.org/en).*

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* `npm run serve` (new Terminal or cmd window)

## Available Tech

The project is compiled with webpack, and out the box, you should be able to use:

* SCSS
* ES6+
* SVG icons
* React
* jQuery (we recommend not using this, but it's available as a last resort)

If you would like to use another technology, such as Angular, feel free to tweak the config to allow it. Just remember that we are more interested in seeing a working solution at the end of the test.

## FAQs

#### Am I allowed to Google stuff
It goes without saying. Please work as you normally would during the day.


#### Something is not working in the build
Try to find a way to fix it, but if you're really stuck â€” contact the person that set up the test for you.


#### Shall I create branches?
If you normally work with feature branches, we would love to see usage of them. No worries if not.


#### I'm finished early, what now?

Firstly, great work. Here are some enhancements:

* Add VAT calculations
* Add currency choice and conversion rates
* Add a payment step
* Add another theme
* Add a product detail modal for each item
* Find a live API and pull the item's content and title from that
* Incorporate markdown to enable easier content editing
* Optimise for ultimate performance
* Incorporate PWA techniques
