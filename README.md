Source files for the technical challenge/test for **Front End Developer** or **Front End Applications Developer** candidates at **MMT Digital.**

## The tests
There are two challenges to undertake in the allotted time.  One tests HTML & CSS skills, and the other JavaScript skills.  Both should be attempted, and the order they are undertaken is up to the candidate - a question of prioritisation!

1. **HTML & CSS Skills:** Page snippet - create, structure and style an HTML element from a given design. Assets provided.
2. **Javascript:** Load, generate and manipulate table data using JavaScript.

## Setting up
The technical tests take place on the test machine in MMT's Batcave (Uppingham). Prior to them arriving, this machine should be running and you should have a printed copy of the test instructions/guide on the table.

Assuming the above is prepared

### Software
For the challenges, a machine needs to be available with:

* Text editor (VSCode or Sublime on machine)
* Google Chrome

If a candidate wishes, the test can be undertaken on a personal machine such as a laptop.  In which case, download the Repository, package it up in Zip format and transfer it to them.

All of the source files for the test should be available in a folder on the Desktop of the machine, and the source files should be already opened in the tools and ready for the candidate to begin working.

## Running an interview: ##
Candidates are given **90 minutes** to attempt the two challenges.

At the beginning of the test, the candidate is informed:

* They should work as they would normally, using familiar coding patterns, naming conventions, 3rd party libraries and tools.
* They should attempt both tasks, so that we can assess their basic HTML & CSS skills, and their Javascript skills.
* Use of Google, Stackoverflow, etc. is permitted.
* Asking for help from other developers at MMT Digital is permitted.
* Any solution is permissible - there is no 'right' answer.

After the allotted time span, return to the candidate and discuss their solution with you - have them:

* Describe how they've worked through the problems.
* Walk you through the code and explain how it works.
* Discuss where they would choose to take their solution in future to improve it, or make it more suitable for other scenarios (reuse, CMS environments, etc.)
* Try to discuss relevant industry and technical background knowledge relevant to the test.

Once the technical interview has finished, these steps should be taken:

* Return the candidate for the general interview
* If required, re-review the test once more. If deemed necessary, it can be backed for further discussion. Otherwise, it can be removed.
*
